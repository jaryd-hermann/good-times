**Stay connected with the people who matter most—in just 3 minutes a day.**

Good Times is a simple, private social app designed for friends and family who want to stay meaningfully connected without the noise of traditional social media. Share one thoughtful answer per day with your private group, and build a beautiful archive of memories together.

**Why Good Times?**

Most of us struggle to keep in touch with the people we care about. Life gets busy, time zones separate us, and finding time for calls or long text conversations can feel overwhelming. Good Times solves this by making daily connection effortless and intentional.

**How It Works**

Every day, your group receives one shared question. Answer it in 3 minutes—with text, photos, videos, or voice notes—and see what everyone else said. It's that simple. No endless scrolling, no algorithms, no public posts. Just genuine connection with the people you love.

**Key Features**

✨ **One Question Per Day**
A thoughtfully curated question arrives daily for your group. Answer when it's convenient for you, and see everyone's responses together.

📸 **Rich Media Sharing**
Express yourself with photos, videos, voice memos, or text. Share moments, memories, and thoughts in whatever format feels right.

👥 **Private Groups**
Create groups for family, friends, or any close-knit circle. Everything stays private within your group—no public profiles, no strangers, no drama.

📚 **Beautiful History**
Your group's answers automatically build into a searchable archive. Relive memories, see how relationships have grown, and discover patterns in your shared story.

🎂 **Birthday Cards**
Never miss a birthday. On each member's special day, your group receives a personalized birthday question. Everyone contributes memories, photos, and messages to create a beautiful digital birthday card. See upcoming birthdays, contribute to others' cards, and enjoy your own card when your day arrives—all automatically handled by Good Times.

💭 **Personalized Questions**
Questions adapt to your group's preferences, including personalized prompts that reference your group members and shared memories.

🕊️ **Memorials & Remembering**
Honor loved ones who have passed. Add memorials to your group with photos and names, and receive special "Remembering Them" prompts personalized with their name. Share stories, memories, and keep their spirit alive in your group's daily conversations. These meaningful prompts help you celebrate and remember together.

🎨 **Explore Collections**
Discover new questions from curated collections like "Optimist," "Soulkeeper," "Storyteller," and more. Find prompts that spark meaningful conversations.

🔒 **Privacy First**
Your data stays private. No ads, no tracking, no selling your information. Just you and your group, sharing authentically.

**Perfect For**

• Families spread across different cities or countries
• Friend groups who want to stay close despite busy lives
• Anyone looking for a genuine alternative to social media
• People who value quality over quantity in their relationships

**What Makes Good Times Different**

Unlike other social apps, Good Times isn't about likes, followers, or going viral. It's about deepening real relationships through consistent, low-pressure connection. Think of it as a daily journal you share with your favorite people—a space where you can be yourself without performance or pressure.
